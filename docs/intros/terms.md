## Glossary

[TODO: This will need a massive edit, and additional info]

Suggested ideas:

Abstraction layer

API - Application programming interface

Arm Mbed CLI - The name of the Arm Mbed [command-line tool](cli.md), packaged as `mbed-cli`.

Arm Mbed interface - The extra chip that sits on all Mbed Enabled development boards. It's what makes the target chip (for example, K64F) look like a USB drive. It usually runs a separate piece of software that generally doesn't change. That software is usually `DAPLink`, `CMSIS-DAP` or `STLink`.

Arm Mbed Online Compiler

Arm Mbed OS

Arm Mbed TLS - A [comprehensive SSL/TLS solution](/docs/v5.4/reference/api-references.html#arm-mbed-tls) that makes it easy for developers to include cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in their software and embedded products. As an SSL library, it provides an intuitive API, readable source code and a minimal and highly configurable code footprint.

Arm Mbed uVisor

BLE - Bluetooth low energy.

Blinky - An [example application](/docs/v5.4/tutorials/your-first-arm-mbed-application.html) that you can use to get to know Arm Mbed OS and the development tools. It’s one of the simplest examples of Mbed OS.

block device

board - An Mbed Enabled development board. You can see a complete list of these [here](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/).

bootloader

build profile

build script

callback

CAN - Controller-area network.

CI - Continuous integration.

CLI - Command-line interface. 

CMSIS-DAP - The precursor to DAPLink, this [project](https://github.com/mbedmicro/cmsis-dap) is deprecated due to known bugs. You should not use it in any new designs.

command-line

DAPLink - An Arm maintained [project](https://github.com/mbedmicro/DAPLink) that is under active development.

debugging

dynamic memory

exporter

Git

GitHub

GPIO

Greentea - **G**eneric **re**gression **en**vironment for **te**st **a**utomation. [Greentea](/docs/v5.4/tools/testing-1.html#greentea---test-automation-for-arm-mbed) is the automated testing tool for Arm Mbed OS development.

`htrun`

I2C - Interintegrated circuit (short-distance, intraboard communication).

IDE - Integrated development environment

LoRA - Long range (low power wireless platform)

Makefile

mesh

platform - See `board`.

porting

pull request

REST - Representational State Transfer (API)

RTOS - Real time operating system

RTX

serial

SPI - Serial peripheral interface

static memory

SSL - Secure sockets layer.

STLink - STMicro's [firmware](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/development-tool-software/stsw-link007.html) that performs the same tasks as DAPLink but uses a different [driver](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/development-tool-software/stsw-link009.html).

target - See `baord`.

terminal application

TLS - Transport layer security.

toolchain

Travis?

utest?
