# Tools

The Mbed product suite includes the tools you need to work with Mbed OS, whatever your skill level.

For most users on Windows, macOS and Linux, we recommend **Mbed Studio**, which is our desktop IDE. Mbed Studio includes the dependencies and tools you need to work with Mbed OS, including access to Arm Compiler 6 to build your code and pyOCD to debug it. For experienced developers, we also include the Mbed command line tools (such as Mbed CLI) with the Mbed Studio installation.

If you prefer to work online, use the **Mbed Online Compiler**, which lets you write and build applications using a web browser with no additional setup.

If you are an experienced developer, you can also set up the command line tools manually by installing **Mbed CLI 1** or **Mbed CLI 2**, a compiler toolchain, a debugger and source control management.

For more information, see [the build tool documentation](../build-tools/index.html).

You can use our debugging tools, DAPLink and pyOCD, to program and debug many devices. At the end of the development cycle, you can use the Mbed OS validation tools, Greentea and utest, to test your project. For more information, see [the debugging and testing documentation](../debug-test/index.html).

Lastly, you can [export your work](../build-tools/third-party-build-tools.html) from the Mbed tools to other IDEs.
