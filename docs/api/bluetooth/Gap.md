# GAP

The Generic Access Profile is the layer of the stack that handles connectivity tasks. This includes link establishment and termination, advertising and scanning.

Devices with data to publish can use GAP to advertise. They can include the data in the advertisement itself, inside the scan response, or leave a peer device to query it after the connection has been established.

The other side of the process is the act of scanning, which listens for advertisements, allows you to query the advertisers for more data through a scan request or connect in order to query the peer device for the data you want.

Advertising, scanning and connection all have parameters that let you find a compromise between desired power consumption levels, latency and efficiency of these processes.

## Advertising

Advertising consists of broadcasting at a regular interval a small amount of data containing valuable information about the device. Peer devices listening on BLE advertising channels may scan these packets.

Scanners may also request additional information from device advertising by sending a scan request. If the broadcaster accepts scan requests, it can reply with a scan response packet containing additional information.

## Scanning

Scanning consists of listening for peer advertising packets. From a scan, a device can identify devices available in its environment.

If the device scans actively, it sends scan request to scannable advertisers and collects their scan responses.

## Extended and periodic advertising

BLE controllers supporting Bluetooth 5.0 may offer additional advertising and scanning options. Use `isFeatureSupported()` to check feature availability.

Extended advertising may use multiple PHYs and spread the payload across many packets. This allows for much larger payloads. In this scenario, advertising is split across primary advertising on the advertising channels and secondary advertising using channels normally used for sending data to connected devices.

Similarly, if the controller supports periodic advertising, you may use periodic advertising to send changing data to many peers. Each peer needs to scan the advertisements on the primary channels and create a sync with a periodic advertisement it's interested in.

There may be many advertising sets active at one time on a single advertiser. This allows it to advertise different data at the same time, possibly to different peers.

Devices that do not support extended and periodic advertising will not see these advertisements. You may use legacy advertising alongside extended advertising, running at the same time, to support older devices in the environment.

## Privacy

Privacy is a feature that allows a device to avoid being tracked by other (untrusted) devices. The device achieves it by periodically generating a new random address. The random address may be a resolvable random address, enabling trusted devices to recognize it as belonging to the same device. These trusted devices receive an Identity Resolution Key (IRK) during pairing. The SecurityManager handles this and relies on the other device accepting and storing the IRK.

You need to enable privacy by calling `enablePrivacy()` after initializing the SecurityManager because privacy requires SecurityManager to handle IRKs. Set the behavior of privacy enabled devices by using `setCentralPrivacyConfiguration()`, which specifies what the device should be with devices using random addresses, and `setPeripheralPrivacyConfiguration`. Random addresses that privacy enabled devices generate can be of two types: resolvable (by devices who have the IRK) and unresolvable. You can't use unresolvable addresses for connecting and connectable advertising; therefore, use a resolvable one for these, regardless of the privacy configuration.

## Modulation schemes

When supported by the host and controller, you can select different modulation schemes:

 - LE 1M PHY.
 - LE 2M PHY.
 - LE coded PHY.

These provide different compromises between bandwidth, power usage and error resiliency (see BLUETOOTH SPECIFICATION Version 5.0 Vol 1, Part A - 1.2).

You may set preferred PHYs (separately for RX and TX) using `setPreferredPhys()`. You may also set the currently used PHYs on a selected connection using `setPhy()`. Both of these settings are only advisory. The controller is allowed to make its own decision on the best PHY to use based on your request, the peer's supported features and the connection's physical conditions.

You may query the currently used PHY using `readPhy()`, which returns the result through a call to the registered event handler. You may register the handler with `setEventHandler()`. The events inform about the currently used PHY and of any changes to PHYs, which the controller or the peer may trigger autonomously.

## Data length (over-the-air MTU)

In addition to modulation schemes, Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size also strongly affects throughput. Newer controllers allow you to negotiate bigger MTUs. Because each packet contains overhead, bigger packets maximize throughput.

There are two separate MTUs to consider: the `ATT_MTU` (maximum attribute size) and data length. `GattServer` and `GattClient` affect `ATT_MTU`. `Gap` only deals with data length, which is the maximum size of the packet that carries attributes that are fragmented across many such packets.

The default value of data length supported by all controllers is 23 octets. If both controllers support data length extension and a higher value is negotiated, the BLE stack will call `onDataLengthChange` in the `Gap::EventHandler` registered by the user.

`ATT_MTU` and data length are independent of each other.
