# iBeacon

iBeacon is an Apple technology based on BLE that you can use as an indoor positioning system. It allows iOS apps to track if the user enters a specific region and offers actions and notification aware of the user context.

The iBeacon class builds an advertising payload mimicking an iBeacon and assigns it to a given BLE interface.

<span class="warnings"> **Warning:** To manufacture iBeacons, you must obtain a license from Apple. For more information, please see [Apple's website](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/). The license also grants access to the iBeacon's technical specification.</span>
