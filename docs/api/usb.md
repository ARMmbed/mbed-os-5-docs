## USB

[Add a brief description of the API. Include common use cases and best practices. This should not be longer than a few paragaphs and probably won't be that long.]

### USB class reference

[Note: Most APIs are classes. If, however, this is a function or a macro, please replace "class" with "function" or "macro".]

[Embed the link to the class reference. If you've never done this, ask your editor for help. It involves linking to the Doxygen and includes some weird formatting. This section should only include the embedded API reference.]

### USB example

[Add a sentence explaining what this example does. Then, embed a linked example. If you've never done this, ask your editor for help. Make sure you create the example in the teams repo.]

### Related content

- [Add links to related content in bullet form. Please note this section is optional. Only include relevant links if they exist. All links here should also appear in the text above.]
