# PwmOut

Use the PwmOut interface to control the frequency and duty cycle of a PWM signal.

**Tips:**

- Set the cycle time first, and then set the duty cycle using either a relative time period via the write() function or an absolute time period using the pulsewidth() function.
- The default period is 0.020s, and the default pulse width is 0.

## PwmOut hello, world

This code example uses the default period of 0.020s and ramps the duty cycle from 0% to 100% in increments of 10%.

## PwmOut code examples

### Example one

This code example sets the period in seconds and the duty cycle as a percentage of the period in floating point (range: 0 to 1). The effect of this code snippet will be to blink LED2 over a four-second cycle, 50% on, for a pattern of two seconds on, two seconds off.

### Example two

The following example does the same thing, but instead of specifying the duty cycle as a relative percentage of the period, it specifies it as an absolute value in seconds. In this case we have a four-second period and a two-second duty cycle, meaning the LED will be on for two seconds and off for two seconds.
