# PortOut

Use the PortOut interface to define which pins of a hardware GPIO port are set as an output and to write those pins. The port name is device specific and defined in the device's `PortNames.h` file in the `mbed-os/targets` folder.

A bit mask defines which pins of the GPIO port are set as an output (`1b` = include, `0b` = ignore). The default mask value is `0xFFFFFFFF` which sets all pins as an output.

The device-specific `PinNames.h` and the respective datasheet or reference manual define the pins associated with a GPIO port.

<span class="notes">**Note:** You can combine pins from different GPIO ports using the [BusOut](busout.html) interface. Use [PortIn](portin.html) to define which GPIO pins are to be used as digital input.</span>
