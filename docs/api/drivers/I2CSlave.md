# I2CSlave

Use I2C Slave to communicate with I2C Master.

Synchronization level: not protected.

<span class="notes">**Note:** Remember that you need a pull-up resistor on sda and scl. All drivers on the I2C bus are required to be open collector, and so it is necessary to use pull-up resistors on the two signals. A typical value for the pull-up resistors is around 2.2k ohms, connected between the pin and 3v3. </span>

## I2CSlave class reference

<span class="notes">**Note:** The Arm Mbed API uses 8 bit addresses, so make sure to left-shift 7 bit addresses by 1 bit before passing them. </span>
