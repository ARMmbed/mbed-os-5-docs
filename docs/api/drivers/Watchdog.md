<span class="images">![](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/development/mbed-os-api-doxy/classmbed_1_1_watchdog.png)<span>Watchdog class hierarchy</span></span>

You can use the Watchdog interface to set up a hardware watchdog timer that resets the system in the case of system failures or malfunctions.

<span class="notes">**Note:** There is only one instance in the system. Use `Watchdog::get_instance()` to obtain a reference. </span>

If you fail to refresh the watchdog periodically, it resets the system after a set period of time.

<span class="notes">**Note:** The maximum amount of time you can set as the Watchdog timeout varies depending on the target hardware. You can check the maximum value by calling `Watchdog::get_instance().get_max_timeout()`.</span>
