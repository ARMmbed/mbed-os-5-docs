# PSA internal storage

PSA internal storage APIs enable saving data to and retrieving data from a PSA internal flash.

The implementation of PSA internal storage varies depending on the target type:

- On a single core ARMv7-M target, PSA internal storage APIs are implemented by calling the default internal TDBStore instance.
- On PSA targets that implement Secure Partition Manager (SPM), PSA internal storage is implemented as a secure service. The service uses an access control list to ensure that it only accesses entries created from the Non-Secure Processing Environment (NSPE).
