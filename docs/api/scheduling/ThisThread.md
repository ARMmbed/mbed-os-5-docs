# ThisThread

Use the ThisThread class to control the current thread.

Unlike the [Thread](../apis/thread.html) API, which allows you to create, join and end threads, ThisThread lets you control the thread that's currently running. A thread may not have a corresponding Mbed Thread object because you can create a thread directly with CMSIS-RTOS APIs, or it might be main's thread. You can't manipulate those with Thread methods, but ThisThread functions still work from inside them.
