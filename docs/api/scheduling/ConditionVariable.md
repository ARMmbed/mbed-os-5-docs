The ConditionVariable class provides a mechanism to safely wait for or signal state changes. A common scenario when writing multithreaded code is to protect shared resources with a mutex and then release that mutex to wait for a change of that data. If you do not do this carefully, this can lead to a race condition in the code. A condition variable provides a safe solution to this problem by handling the wait for a state change, along with releasing and acquiring the mutex automatically during this waiting period. Note that you cannot make wait or notify calls on a condition variable from ISR context. Unlike EventFlags, ConditionVariable does not let you wait on multiple events at the same time.

## ConditionVariable example

Below is an example of ConditionVariable usage, where one thread is generating events every 1s, and the second thread is waiting for the events and executing an action.
