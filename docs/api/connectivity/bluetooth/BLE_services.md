# BLE Services

Mbed OS BLE implementation isn't bundled with any BLE services. Services are however provided in this external repository:

- [Experimental services for Mbed OS BLE](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-experimental-ble-services)

This is a community led effort to provide implementations of services both from the official BLE specification and user defined ones. It contains libraries which you can import into your project to use the services. For details see the documentation in the repository:

- [README.md](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-experimental-ble-services/blob/main/README.md)
