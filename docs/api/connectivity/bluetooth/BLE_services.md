# BLE Services

Mbed OS BLE implementation isn't bundled with any BLE services. Services are in an external repository. Please go to:
- [ble-services](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-experimental-ble-services)

This is a community led effort to provide implementations of services both from the official BLE spec and user defined
ones. It contains libraries which you can import into your project to use the services. Please refer to documentation
inside the repository:
- [README.md](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-experimental-ble-services/blob/main/README.md)
