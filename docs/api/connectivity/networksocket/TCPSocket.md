The TCPSocket class provides the ability to send a stream of data over TCP. TCPSockets maintain a stateful connection that starts with the `connect` member function. After successfully connecting to a server, you can use the `send` and `recv` member functions to send and receive data (similar to writing or reading from a file).

The constructor takes no parameters. To initialize the socket on a specified NetworkInterface, you must call `open` method, which takes a NetworkStack pointer.

## Server socket

You can also use TCP to listen to incoming connections. To do this:

1. Bind socket to specific port by calling `TCPSocket::bind()`.
1. Set socket to listening mode by calling `TCPSocket::listen()`.
1. Accept incoming connection by calling `TCPSocket::accept()`.

Accepting a new connection returns a pointer to a new `Socket` object that you can use to communicate with the connected peer. Afterward, call this socket's `close()` function to shut down the connection and clean up the reserved resources.

Accepting a connection leaves the original socket in listening mode. You can continue to accept new connections until you destroy the listening socket, or call its `close()` method.
