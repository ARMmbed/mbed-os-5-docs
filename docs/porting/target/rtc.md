<h1 id="rtc-port">RTC</h1>

Implementing RTC enables Mbed OS to keep track of the current time. The standard library time keeping functions, such as `time`, use it.

## Assumptions

### Defined behavior

- The function `rtc_init` is safe to call repeatedly.
- RTC accuracy is at least 10%.
- `Init`/`free` doesn't stop RTC from counting.
- Software reset doesn't stop RTC from counting.
- Sleep modes don't stop RTC from counting.
- Shutdown mode doesn't stop RTC from counting.

### Undefined behavior

- Calling any function other than `rtc_init` before the initialization of the RTC.

### Notes

Watch out for these common trouble areas when implementing this API:

- Incorrect overflow handling.
- Glitches due to ripple counter.

## Dependencies

Hardware RTC capabilities.

## Implementing the RTC API

You can find the API and specification for the RTC API in the following header file:

To enable RTC support in Mbed OS, add the `RTC` label in the `device_has` option of the target's section in the `targets.json` file.

## Testing

The Mbed OS HAL provides a set of conformance tests for RTC. You can use these tests to validate the correctness of your implementation. To run the RTC HAL tests, use the following command:

```
mbed test -t <toolchain> -m <target> -n "tests-mbed_hal-rtc*"
```
