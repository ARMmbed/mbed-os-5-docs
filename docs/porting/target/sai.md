<h1 id="sai-port">Serial Audio Interface (SAI)</h1>

The **Serial Audio Interface** allows you to send or receive an audio stream over a synchronous serial interface made of 3 to 4 lines.

- SD: serial data.
- BCLK: bit Clock.
- WCLK: word Clock.
- MCLK: main Clock (optional).

A typical use case of this interface is with Codecs and DACs or ADCs to sample, process and output an audio signal.

This highly configurable interface has a wide range of elements you can adjust:

- Word length.
- Data length (inside words).
- Clocks polarity and phase.
- Data alignment.

<span class="warnings">**Warning:** We are introducing the SAI API in an upcoming release of Mbed OS. This page documents code that exists on a feature branch of Mbed OS. You can find details on how it may affect you in the [implementing the SAI API](#implementing-the-sai-api) section.

## Assumptions

### Defined behavior

- `sai_init()` returns `SAI_RESULT_INVALID_PARAM` if at least one of the given parameters is undefined (NULL).
- `sai_init()` returns `SAI_RESULT_ALREADY_INITIALIZED` if SAI is already initialized.
- `sai_init()` returns `SAI_RESULT_CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED` if the device can never support this configuration.
- `sai_init()` returns `SAI_RESULT_CONFIG_MISMATCH` if the device is not able to support this configuration now because of other 'live' constraints, such as a shared format or clock configuration with a sibling.
- `sai_free()` does nothing if passed a NULL pointer.
- `sai_free()` deinitializes and disables associated clocks if the peripheral is no longer in use.
- You can reinitialize a device or block by using `sai_init()` after you use `sai_free()` on it.

If the device is a *receiver*:

- `sai_transfer()` returns false if the `sai_t` object is NULL.
- `sai_transfer()` returns false if there's no sample in the FiFo.
- `sai_transfer()` if `psample` is NULL; it pops 1 sample from the FiFo and returns true.
- `sai_transfer()` if `psample` is not NULL; it pops 1 sample from the FiFo, stores it to the address pointed by `psample` and returns true.

If the device is a *transmitter*:

- `sai_transfer()` returns false if the `sai_t` object is NULL.
- `sai_transfer()` returns false if the FiFo is full and you can't push `*psample`.
- `sai_transfer()` if `psample` is NULL; it pushes one '0' sample to the FiFo and returns true.
- `sai_transfer()` if `psample` is not NULL; it pushes the pointed sample to the FiFo and returns true.

### Undefined behavior

- Calling any function other than `sai_init()` before the initialization of the SAI.
- Calling any function other than `sai_init()` after calling `sai_free()`.

### Other requirements

A target must also define these elements to allow tests to be run:

- `#define SAI_DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE (xxxxxU)`.
  The tests use this macro to validate that the device behaves as expected. This parameter is device dependent; you need to set it to any value that the target supports.
- Pins for 2 SAI or I2S interfaces, including MCLK, BCLK, WCLK and SD named:
  - SAI_A_MCLK, SAI_A_BCLK, SAI_A_WCLK and SAI_A_SD.
  - SAI_B_MCLK, SAI_B_BCLK, SAI_B_WCLK and SAI_B_SD.

### Notes

When implementing this API, consider a transceiver supporting asynchronous rx/tx as 2 different peripherals:

   - One read-only.
   - One write-only.

The first allocated channel may or may not limit the second one's feature. For example, in a peripheral that supports asynchronous rx/tx but requires the format of both instances to be the same, the first allocated instance sets the format and ties the second one to this format.

## Dependencies

Hardware SAI/I2S capabilities.

## Implementing the SAI API

You can find the API and specification for the SAI API in the following class reference:

[![View code](https://www.mbed.com/embed/?type=library)](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.14/feature-hal-spec-sai-doxy/classmbed_1_1_s_a_i.html)

To enable SAI support in Mbed OS, add the `SAI` label in the `device_has` option of the target's section in the `targets.json` file.

## Testing

The Mbed OS HAL provides a set of conformance tests for SAI. You can use these tests to validate the correctness of your implementation. To run the SAI HAL tests, use the following command:

```
mbed test -t <toolchain> -m <target> -n "tests-mbed_hal-sai*"
```
