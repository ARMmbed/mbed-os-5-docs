# Porting PSA targets

This document describes the process of adding new PSA targets to Mbed OS, focusing on target configurations, build and validation. Mbed OS relies on [TF-M](https://git.trustedfirmware.org/trusted-firmware-m.git/tree/) for its implementation of PSA, so the PSA target you are adding to Mbed OS **must** already be supported by TF-M.

Before reading this document, please read [porting a custom board](../porting/porting-a-custom-board.html) and [porting targets](../porting/porting-the-hal-apis.html), which provide step-by-step instructions to porting a new target to Mbed OS.

## Glossary

- **NSPE:** Non-Secure Processing Environment.
- **PSA:** Platform Security Architecture.
- **SPE:** Secure Processing Environment.
- **TF-M:** Trusted Firmware M (for M-class devices).

## Adding new PSA targets

To help create PSA targets, we have added a few generic targets to `targets/targets.json`:

* `PSA_Target`: Root level PSA target.
* `PSA_V7_M`: Single v7-M generic PSA target, which doesn't employ hardware isolation between the NSPE and the SPE, so TF-M is not supported. PSA secure service emulation enables PSA API compatibility.
* `PSA_DUAL_CORE`: Dual-core generic PSA target. A dual-core PSA target has at least two cores that are either Armv7-M or Armv6-M. One core will be used for the SPE and another for the NSPE. Hardware isolation between the cores enables PSA compliance. On dual-core targets, TF-M
runs on the SPE and provides PSA services, and Mbed OS runs on the NSPE.
* `PSA_V8_M`: Armv8-M generic PSA target, which employs hardware to isolate the NSPE from the SPE. TF-M runs on the SPE and provides PSA services, and Mbed OS runs on the NSPE.

### NSPE generic targets

SPE binaries are generated by TF-M build tools, not Mbed-OS build tools. Therefore, when adding a new PSA target to Mbed OS, you don't need to define an SPE target; it's enough to define an NSPE target. Therefore, for dual-core (`PSA_DUAL_CORE`) and Armv8-M (`PSA_V8_M`), we have defined only PSA NSPE generic targets.

### Inheritance

The Mbed OS build tools have limited support for multiple inheritance. Because of this, a PSA target must inherit from the generic PSA target corresponding to the new target's architecture (one of `PSA_V7_M`, `PSA_DUAL_CORE` and `PSA_V8_M`) *or* from one of its family targets, but cannot inherit from both the generic and family targets at once. We cover family inheritance cases in each target section in this document.

<span class="notes">**Note:** The examples in this document are taken from `targets/targets.json`.</span>

Example of a single-core Armv7-M PSA target's inheritance:

```json
    "K64F": {
        "inherits": ["PSA_V7_M"]
    }
```

### Adding single-core (non-TF-M) PSA targets

Mbed OS's PSA service emulation provides PSA compatibility for single-core PSA
targets which do not support TF-M.

The following example shows a PSA-enabled single-core target, `K64F`:

```json
    "K64F": {
        "supported_form_factors": [
            "ARDUINO"
        ],
        "components_add": [
            "SD",
            "FLASHIAP"
        ],
        "core": "Cortex-M4F",
        "supported_toolchains": [
            "ARM",
            "GCC_ARM",
            "IAR"
        ],
        "extra_labels_add": [
            "Freescale",
            "MCUXpresso_MCUS",
            "KSDK2_MCUS",
            "FRDM",
            "KPSDK_MCUS",
            "KPSDK_CODE",
            "MCU_K64F",
            "Freescale_EMAC"
        ],
        "is_disk_virtual": true,
        "macros_add": [
            "CPU_MK64FN1M0VMD12",
            "FSL_RTOS_MBED",
            "MBED_SPLIT_HEAP",
            "MBED_TICKLESS"
        ],
        "inherits": [
            "PSA_V7_M"
        ],
        "detect_code": [
            "0240"
        ],
        "device_has_add": [
            "USTICKER",
            "LPTICKER",
            "RTC",
            "CRC",
            "ANALOGIN",
            "ANALOGOUT",
            "EMAC",
            "I2C",
            "I2CSLAVE",
            "INTERRUPTIN",
            "PORTIN",
            "PORTINOUT",
            "PORTOUT",
            "PWMOUT",
            "RESET_REASON",
            "SERIAL",
            "SERIAL_FC",
            "SERIAL_ASYNCH",
            "SLEEP",
            "SPI",
            "SPI_ASYNCH",
            "SPISLAVE",
            "STDIO_MESSAGES",
            "TRNG",
            "FLASH",
            "USBDEVICE",
            "WATCHDOG"
        ],
        "release_versions": [
            "2",
            "5"
        ],
        "device_name": "MK64FN1M0xxx12",
        "bootloader_supported": true,
        "overrides": {
            "network-default-interface-type": "ETHERNET"
        },
        "supported_c_libs": {
            "arm": [
                "std",
                "small"
            ],
            "gcc_arm": [
                "std",
                "small"
            ],
            "iar": [
                "std"
            ]
        }
    }
```

Note the config options `macros_add`, `extra_labels_add` and `device_has_add`. To add or remove `macros`, `extra_labels` or target capabilities, a PSA target definition **must** use [macros/extra_labels/device_has]`_add` or [macros/extra_labels/device_has]`_remove` (not `macros`, `extra_labels` or `device_has`).

To add or remove a feature, use `feature_`[add/remove].

As a second example, here is a single-core Armv7-M PSA target that inherits from one of its family targets:

```json
    "GD32_F450ZI": {
        "inherits": [
            "GD32_Target"
        ]
    }
```

In this case, you must add the following additional attributes:

```json
        "features_add": [
            "PSA"
        ],
        "extra_labels_add": [
            "MBED_PSA_SRV"
        ]
```

### Adding TF-M (dual-core or Armv8-M) PSA targets

An Mbed OS (NSPE) target that supports TF-M must contain the following attributes (in addition to other target attributes defined in [porting a custom board](../porting/porting-a-custom-board.html) and [porting targets](../porting/porting-the-hal-apis.html)):

* `inherits`: PSA generic target `PSA_DUAL_CORE` or `PSA_V8_M`, unless the target has to inherit
  from one of its family targets.
* `extra_labels`: `TARGET_`[label] paths to enable.
  * `TFM_LATEST`: If the current version of TF-M (that Mbed OS is integrated with) is supported by the target. The current version is indicated in [mbed-os-tf-m-regression-tests](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-tf-m-regression-tests).
  * `TFM_V`[major]`_`[minor]: If a legacy release of TF-M is supported by the target.
* `macros_add`: C/C++ macros that are globally set during compilation.
  * `BL2`: If the TF-M bootloader is supported by the target.
  * `MCUBOOT_IMAGE_NUMBER=2`: If the secure and non-secure images are in two separate bootloader slots.
* `tfm_target_name`: Target name in TF-M.
* `tfm_bootloader_supported`: If the TF-M bootloader is supported by the target.

    The supported values are `true` and `false`.
* `tfm_supported_toolchains`: Supported TF-M toolchains.

    The supported values are `ARMCLANG` and `GNUARM`.
* `tfm_default_toolchain`: Default TF-M toolchain.

    The supported values are `ARMCLANG` and `GNUARM`.
* `tfm_delivery_dir`: The directory to which TF-M binaries will be copied.
* `TFM_OUTPUT_EXT`: Optional attribute that indicates the output extension of the TF-M secure binary.
* `post_binary_hook`:
  * `function`: The target's post binary hook ([class].[method]) in `tools/targets/__init__.py` for image signing, required if the TF-M bootloader support is supported.
* `secure_image_filename`: The file name of the TF-M secure binary, to be signed by the post binary hook.

**Note**: When `inherits` is used, some of attributes are set by the PSA generic target.

The following example shows a PSA-enabled Armv8-M PSA target, `ARM_MUSCA_S1`:

```json
    "ARM_MUSCA_S1": {
        "inherits": [
            "PSA_V8_M"
        ],
        "default_toolchain": "ARMC6",
        "features_add": [
            "EXPERIMENTAL_API"
        ],
        "forced_reset_timeout": 20,
        "release_versions": [
            "5"
        ],
        "core": "Cortex-M33-NS",
        "supported_toolchains": [
            "ARMC6",
            "GCC_ARM"
        ],
        "device_has_add": [
            "INTERRUPTIN",
            "I2C",
            "I2CSLAVE",
            "LPTICKER",
            "SERIAL",
            "SLEEP",
            "USTICKER"
        ],
        "macros_add": [
            "__STARTUP_CLEAR_BSS",
            "MBED_FAULT_HANDLER_DISABLED",
            "CMSIS_NVIC_VIRTUAL",
            "LPTICKER_DELAY_TICKS=3",
            "MBED_MPU_CUSTOM",
            "BL2",
            "MCUBOOT_IMAGE_NUMBER=2"
        ],
        "extra_labels_add": [
            "ARM_SSG",
            "MUSCA_S1"
        ],
        "post_binary_hook": {
            "function": "ArmMuscaS1Code.binary_hook"
        },
        "secure_image_filename": "tfm_s.bin",
        "tfm_target_name": "musca_s1",
        "tfm_bootloader_supported": true,
        "tfm_default_toolchain": "ARMCLANG",
        "tfm_supported_toolchains": [
            "ARMCLANG",
            "GNUARM"
        ],
        "tfm_delivery_dir": "TARGET_ARM_SSG/TARGET_MUSCA_S1",
        "detect_code": [
            "5009"
        ]
    }
```

Please note the config options `features_add`, `macros_add`, `extra_labels_add` and `device_has_add`. To add or remove `features`, `macros`, `extra_labels` or target capabilities, a PSA target definition must use
[features/macros/extra_labels/device_has]`_add` or [features/macros/extra_labels/device_has]`_remove` (not `features`, `macros`, `extra_labels` or `device_has`).

By default, a TF-M build generates a `bin` file. If the target requires a `hex` file, you need to add the attribute `"TFM_OUTPUT_EXT": "hex"` to the target definition. The build script will convert `bin` to `hex`, then copy the `hex` to `tfm_delivery_dir`. You must also update `secure_image_filename` to match the new file extension.

If a PSA target cannot inherit from `PSA_V8_M` or `PSA_DUAL_CORE` because it has to inherit from one of its family targets, you must declare PSA and TF-M attributes manually. For example,

```json
        "features_add": [
            "PSA"
        ],
        "extra_labels_add": [
            "TFM",
            "TFM_LATEST",
            "TFM_V8M"
        ]
```
(Please adjust the TF-M version and target architecture accordingly.)

## Build and validation

The [mbed-os-tf-m-regression-tests repository](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-tf-m-regression-tests) contains build scripts, TF-M regression tests and PSA API compliance tests. Please follow instructions there to build and validate your TF-M target.

### Building TF-M and creating an Mbed OS pull request

<span class="notes">**Note:** Please ensure that both regression tests and PSA API compliance tests pass before creating an Mbed OS pull request.</span>

To build TF-M and create an Mbed OS pull request:

1. Switch to the `mbed-os-tf-m-regression-tests` directory.
1. Run:

    ```
    python3 build_tfm.py -m <new target> -t <toolchain> --commit
    ```

    The command builds TF-M with the config `CoreIPC`, copies the TF-M binary to the location defined by the target attribute `tfm_delivery_dir`, and commits the changes to Mbed OS.

    <span class="tips">**Tip:** When you run the Python script `build_tfm.py` without any options, TF-M is built for all supported targets and the secure binary (TF-M) for each target is copied to the location defined by the target attribute `tfm_delivery_dir`. When you use the `--commit` option, a new Mbed OS commit is created with the new or modified TF-M binaries and `features/FEATURE_EXPERIMENTAL_API/FEATURE_PSA/TARGET_TFM/VERSION.txt`.</span>

1. Switch to the `mbed-os` directory and check the latest commit.

   If everything looks good, push the changes to your fork of Mbed OS.
1. Create an Mbed OS pull request against [https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os).

    <span class="tips">**Tip:** See the [contributing guide](../contributing/index.html) for more information about pull requests.</span>
