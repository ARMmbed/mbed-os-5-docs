<h1 id="quick-start">Arm Mbed OS quick start</h1>

This quick start gets an example application running on your board. It shows how to create and build an application, select your build target, flash your board and interact with your device.

Blinky is a simple application that blinks the LED on your development board every 500 milliseconds.

The quick start offers two versions of Blinky: the full profile version and the bare metal version. The workflow for both is identical, but the source code is imported from different repositories.
