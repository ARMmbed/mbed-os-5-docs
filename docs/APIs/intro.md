# Writing applications with the mbed OS APIs

mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices, by providing the layer that interprets your application's code in a way the hardware can understand.

Your application code - written in C++ - uses the application programing interfaces (APIs) presented by mbed OS to receive information from the hardware and send instructions to it. This means that a lot of the challenges in getting started with microcontrollers or integrating large amounts of software is already taken care of.

To learn how to use the APIs to write your application, we'll start by reviewing how to use them to [control the flow of the application by managing its tasks](../getting_started/flow_contro.md). We'll also introduce simple input and output controls.

Once you're familiar with the basic concepts, you can move on to more advances examples that will demonstrate a broader use of the APIs:

* [Building an internet connected lighting system](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/building-an-internet-connected-lighting-system/en/latest/).
* [Building a LoRa network](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/lora-with-mbed/en/latest/).
* Or any of the other examples [on our full list](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/examples-list/en/latest/).
