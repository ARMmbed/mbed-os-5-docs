# Writing applications with the mbed OS APIs

mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices, by providing the layer that interprets your application's code in a way the hardware can understand.

Your application code is written in C++. It uses the application programming interfaces (APIs) that mbed OS provides. These APIs allow your code to work on different microcontrollers in a uniform way. This reduces a lot of the challenges in getting started with microcontrollers and integrating large amounts of software.

To use the APIs to write your application, start by reviewing how to use them to [control the flow of the application by managing its tasks](../getting_started/flow_control.md). We'll also introduce simple input and output controls.

Once you're familiar with the basic concepts, you can move on to more advanced examples that will demonstrate a broader use of the APIs:

* [Building an internet connected lighting system](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/building-an-internet-connected-lighting-system/en/latest/).
* [Building a LoRa network](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/lora-with-mbed/en/latest/).
* Or any of the other examples [on our full list](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/examples-list/en/latest/).
