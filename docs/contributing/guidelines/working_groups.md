# Working Groups

Mbed OS has a number of established working groups aimed at improving and building new services and features. The working groups bring together like-minded individuals and teams of similar interests, providing a platform to share feedback and discuss what can be delivered as a community.

You can join a working group by contributing ideas, initiating discussions and sharing your latest projects. We welcome all forms of contributions to the working groups.

Current working groups include:
* [Experimental BLE Services](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-experimental-ble-services/discussions)
* [Tools and Build System](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-tools/discussions)
* [Nordic Platforms](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-wg-nordic-platforms/discussions)

If you would like to join a working group, we welcome your contributions via the groups linked above. If you have a suggestion for a new working group, [please add them to our forum here](https://forums.mbed.com/t/mbed-os-working-groups/11730).
