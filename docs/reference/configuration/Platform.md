<h2 id="configuration-platform">Platform</h2>

The platform configurations allow for customization of platform level OS options. Such options include error handling properties and serial communication configuration settings for STDIO, which work out of platform as they affect system level printf calls, not Serial objects with the excetion of `default-serial-baud-rate`.

The following is the complete list of platform configuration parameters, as generated by `mbed compile --config -v`. Please see [the configuration system documentation](/docs/development/reference/configuration.html) for details on how you may use or override these settings.

```
Configuration parameters
------------------------

Name: platform.default-serial-baud-rate
    Description: Default baud rate for a Serial or RawSerial instance (if not specified in the constructor)
    Defined by: library:platform
    Macro name: MBED_CONF_PLATFORM_DEFAULT_SERIAL_BAUD_RATE
    Value: 9600 (set by library:platform)
Name: platform.error-all-threads-info

    Defined by: library:platform
    No value set
Name: platform.error-filename-capture-enabled
    Description: Enables capture of filename and line number as part of error context capture, this works only for debug and develop builds. On release builds, filename capture is always disabled
    Defined by: library:platform
    No value set
Name: platform.error-hist-enabled
    Description: Enable for error history tracking.
    Defined by: library:platform
    No value set
Name: platform.error-hist-size
    Description: Set the number of most recent errors the system keeps in its history, needs error-hist-enabled set to true for this to work.
    Defined by: library:platform
    Macro name: MBED_CONF_PLATFORM_ERROR_HIST_SIZE
    Value: 4 (set by library:platform)
Name: platform.force-non-copyable-error
    Description: Force compile time error when a NonCopyable object is copied
    Defined by: library:platform
    No value set
Name: platform.max-error-filename-len
    Description: Sets the maximum length of buffer used for capturing the filename in error context. This needs error-filename-capture-enabled feature.
    Defined by: library:platform
    Macro name: MBED_CONF_PLATFORM_MAX_ERROR_FILENAME_LEN
    Value: 16 (set by library:platform)
Name: platform.poll-use-lowpower-timer
    Description: Enable use of low power timer class for poll(). May cause missing events.
    Defined by: library:platform
    No value set
Name: platform.stdio-baud-rate
    Description: Baud rate for stdio
    Defined by: library:platform
    Macro name: MBED_CONF_PLATFORM_STDIO_BAUD_RATE
    Value: 9600 (set by library:platform)
Name: platform.stdio-buffered-serial
