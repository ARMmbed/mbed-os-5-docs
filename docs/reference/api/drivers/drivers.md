## Drivers overview

Driver APIs include analog and digital inputs and outputs on development boards, as well as digital interfaces, which allow your board to interface with a computer or external devices. With these drivers, you can read or set the voltage of analog pins, control digital pins individually or as a grouped value and trigger an event when a digital input pin changes value. You can also control the frequency and mark to space ratio of a digital pulse wave (or train).
