## iBeacon

iBeacon is an Apple technology based on BLE that you can use as an indoor positioning system. It allows iOS apps to track if the user enters a specific region and offers actions and notification aware of the user context.

The iBeacon class builds an advertising payload mimicking an iBeacon and assigns it to a given BLE interface.
